  <p>According to the UB ACM constitution, an eligible voting member is defined as a member with <strong>3 events logged in our <a href="/checkins/list">check-ins system</a></strong>. The election itself counts towards an event, so if you haven&#39;t reached 3 check-ins yet, you can come in-person on the day of the election and become an eligible voting member. For members who cannot attend the election in person, a livestream will be made available on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubacm.org/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
  <p><small>If you are opting to vote online, you must already have 3 check-ins prior to the election as the online vote does not count towards a check-in.</small></p>
  <h2 id="rundown-and-how-to-vote">Rundown and How to Vote</h2>
  <p>Members will be voting through an online form made available within the Slack workspace while the election is underway. Each officer position will be voted on consecutively, in the order of the positions listed above in <small>1</small> .</p>

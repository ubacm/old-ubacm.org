          <h3>What is Hackspace?</h3>
          <p class="big">University at Buffalo's computer science and engineering coworking hackerspace, managed by UB ACM.
            The Hackspace is a 30-person room that is dedicated as a computer science and engineering coworking hackerspace.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Can I work here?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! Hackspace, just like our club, is open for all UB students to use as long as the following rules are followed:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Respect others who are using the space for work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep the room clean and tidy. If you have garbage you'd like to throw out, there is a
              convenient garbage can located right outside the room.
            </li>
            <li>
              No food is allowed. The Hackspace is not a space with custodial services. 
              We don't want to harbor fruit flies.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Any infractions will result in a warning or ban from using the Hackspace.</p>
  
          <h3>Want more hacking?</h3>
          <p>
            UB ACM runs a biweekly hack session called <a href="/hack">Hack Nights</a>, where Hackspace is open for students to work on Saturdays. We serve snacks and light refreshments, offer end-of-semester prizes, help sponsors recruit interns/full timers, and more!<br />

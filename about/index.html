       <h3>Discord</h3>
        <p>We moved away from newsletters and Slack to Discord to encourage more communication and discussion between students outside of our events. Our Discord server has registered over 400 verified (current and past) University at Buffalo students.</p>
  
  <h3>Away Hackathons</h3>
        <p>In addition to <a href="https://ubhacking.com">UB Hacking</a> and <a href="/hack">Hack Nights</a>, our club also organizes members to attend hackathons together near our school. Attending hackathons are a great way for students to learn new technologies and show some pride for our school.<br />
        <br />
        For the first time in the 2018 season, we placed University at Buffalo on the <a href="https://mlh.io/standings/na-2018">MLH rank standings</a>!

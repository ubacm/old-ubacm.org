# Check-Ins

UB ACM requires everyone who attends our events to check in. As a University at Buffalo student organization, we are required to collect the _UBIT ID_ of students who attend our events. The best way to collect this, according to the University, would be through the UBLinked Event Pass.

## Why do I need to check in?
You need to check in in order to be included in the official club membership count. This number is important to the club because it is reported to the two University at Buffalo entities we're housed under - the Student Association and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Additionally, in order to be able to run for an elected position and vote in club elections, you must have checked in to at least three club events in the academic year.

<!-- TODO: Reinstate this when the 2020/2021 raffle is set up -->
<!-- As for members, for every check-in, we will provide *UB ACM check-in marks* weighted differently for events. -->
<!-- * *1 Mark*: Weekly Meeting Events (workshops, tech talks, and social events) -->
<!-- * _Other opportunities will award Marks based on the discretion of the UB ACM leadership._ -->

<!-- Collecting check-in marks will allow members to have: -->
<!-- * Priority food pickup at [Hack Nights](/hack). -->
<!-- * Priority registration at UB ACM social events. -->
<!-- * End-of-year raffle tickets. [Learn more about the raffle here!](/checkins/raffle)  -->

<!-- <small>UB ACM leadership members cannot be rewarded with Marks and cannot benefit from Mark bonuses. Members who violate club rules are subject to have partial or all awarded Marks rescinded. Marks are not currency and have no monetary value.</small> -->
